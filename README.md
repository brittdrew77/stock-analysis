# Stock Analysis
## 1. Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to refactor code, so it will be more efficient. Steve wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market for 2017 and 2018. We want the code to work faster and more efficiently for a larger dataset. 
## 2. Results
I found that for the year 2017 the code ran in 0.164 seconds and for the year 2018 the code ran in 0.160 seconds. Both times are very close for the two years. Before refactoring the code, it ran slightly slower.

## 3. Summary
### 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
An advantage of refactoring code is the efficiency. Refactoring condenses code allowing it to run faster and smoother overall. Another advantage is that the code is less lenghty and complex. This means that it can be read and understood more easily. A disadvantage is that it must be executed and written properly or it could create new errors and bugs in the code. A disadvantage could be the time it takes to edit and repurpose the code.  
### 2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
We saw that refactoring the code in VBA made the code run faster than before. It did take time for me to go through the entire script and figure out what can be kept and what can be changed to improve efficiency. With creating new variables, I ran into some errors and had to retrace my steps to ensure all would work successfully.
